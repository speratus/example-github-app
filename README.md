# Speratus' Commit Tracker
Speratus' Commit Tracker is a GitHub App running on Glitch. It's purpose is to provide a
breakdown of how many commits the User pushes per week. Although commit numbers can be found on GitHub itself,
this app gathers them into one place and provides a breakdown of commits per day.

It works by connecting to GitHub and receiving push webhooks from GitHub.

# Setup
In order to get the commit tracker working, you will need to have a GitHub account.

The first step is to create a new GitHub app. You can create a new app by [going here](https://github.com/settings/apps) if 
you are signed in to GitHub.
